This repo includes reproductions of part of the results from 

### Accurate Path Integration in Continuous Attractor Network Models of Grid Cells 
#### Burak & Fiete 2009

as well as complementary investigations. 

This project is our final project for Theoretical Neuroscience class at ENS-PSL. An overview of the work is available in the **evaluate_grid.ipynb** notebook


### Python files descriptions
- **grid.py** The continuous attractor model code
- **options.py** The options object class for defining grid models
- **analysis.py** Functions for analysing the grid cells model
- **plotting.py** Functions to make all the plots in the notebook
- **solvers.py** ODE solvers
- **tilings.py** Functions to generate angle preference tiling
